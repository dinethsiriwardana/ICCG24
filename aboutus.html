        <p class="text-center" style="text-align: justify;">Career Guidance Unit helps undergraduates to develop their skills and abilities of selfassessment information seeking and decision making required for coping with the needs of complex of world of work &amp; to develop lifelong learning ambitions. University of Ruhuna established the Career Guidance Unit in March 2000 to provide innovative and inclusive support to University of Ruhuna students, supporting their transition from study to future opportunities. We are planning to develop and maintain partnerships with a wide variety of employers and industry professionals to get in-depth knowledge and to provide greater development opportunities. Success in career guidance depends on providing up to date information on training &amp; employment opportunities and having a good knowledge of available opportunities in the local and international training market. For that, we plan to run interactive events and training sessions, enabling us to provide inclusive, comprehensive and accessible careers and employability support. Beginning from the University Studentship at the University of Ruhuna, the Career Guidance Unit (CGU) helps to chart the path towards the first destination upon graduation. In this endeavor, the career guidance unit is to assist the undergraduates in acquiring attributes and soft skills which can assist them in reaching standards matching the potential employerâ€™s requirements. To this end, CGU usually conducts a number of programs on various aspects of career aimed at increasing the soft skills aspects in e.g. Personality development, qualities of leadership, communication and presentation skills etc., and in pragmatic training of e.g. writing an effective CV, facing interviews etc., to help in building self-confidence and in preparation to undertake progressive steps towards entering the corporate sector. CGU also provides opportunities for our graduates to secure employment in reputable companies in the corporate sector, and thereby sets the stage for both graduates and the industry to benefit mutually. According to circular No. 934, research and development is a one of the recommended focal areas for conducting career related programs in universities.</p>
